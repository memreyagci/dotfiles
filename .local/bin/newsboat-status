# A bash script that prints the number of unread RSS feeds from newsboat
# For the icon to work, Font awesome needs to be installed. See: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome
# If you don't want any icon, add a text or anything, just edit after "echo" however you like. $unread variable is the number of unread RSS feeds.
